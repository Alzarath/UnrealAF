# UnrealAF
Unreal Tournament-themed mod for Acolyte Fight

This is mostly a repository for templating the [AFModCompiler](https://github.com/Alzarath/AFModCompiler) and is not a 100% finished mod, but it's mostly functional. I would like to continue development on it, and this may be a good excuse, but it's been a long time.

To use this, download the [AFModCompiler](https://github.com/Alzarath/AFModCompiler) and run it from within the project directory or pointing at the project directory. For example:

```py
python AFModCompiler.py UnrealAF/
```

It will generate a mod json file that you can then load from the [Acolyte Fight Website](https://acolytefight.io/)'s [Mod Overview](https://acolytefight.io/modding) section.
